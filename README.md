# IrishSeaRadiationMonitoring
An older project from when I was learning PostgreSQL, PostGIS and QGIS. It uses EPA Ireland's radiation monitoring data from 1962-2006 and applies IDW to show the radiation levels for the particular sample at that time. An animation was also created showing a time lapse of sampling over the years. 

Initially i was goign to upoad all files, inclusing shapefiles for the irish sea, radiation measurement locations and nuclear power plants, but GIT didnt like their size.
